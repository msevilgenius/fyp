todo:
2nd half of eval
conclusion eval summary
— talk about hops testing method

hops test data in appendix

1/2 done:
— You should also include a good amount of text on other DHT approaches,  such as Pastry, Tapestry, Bamboo etc. A discussion on systems that use/are based on DHTs is also required. Memcached is a good start.
— The discussion on Boost.Asio should be extended.
— EVALUATION
— CONCLUSION
— SUMMARY

done:
— You could also describe how you would implement other applications (e.g. pub/sub, storage, group communication etc.) in details even though you haven’t actually written the code.
— Introduction: when you say 'and those still to be completed’, it seems that the report will present half-baked work. I would instead prefer an expression that talks about ‘future work’.
— The discussion on  libevent should be extended.
— You should say that an extensive discussion about Chord is in the design section.
— Intro should be section 1.
— Figure 2 is not referenced in the text. Figures that are not yours must reference their source.
