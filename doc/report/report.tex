\section{Introduction}

%this should give the motivation for the project. The aims of the project should at least be stated in the first paragraph, but preferably in the first sentence.

to build a system for creating distributed computing applications more easily by implementing a consistent means of organising computing nodes and enabling communication between them without each node's applications needing knowledge of the other nodes in the system.
